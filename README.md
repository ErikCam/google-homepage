# google-homepage
My first mini-project :)

This is my first ever self project done on my own so bare with me as I try to improve my skills.
I am trying to make an exact replica of the google homepage, but the links and buttons
will not go anywhere, this is pure aesthetic. Upon completion, I will update on what I 
learned from the project. Stay tuned!

Updating after almost 3 weeks of completing my project. I didn't even realize I didn't update 
my README until now, but better late than never! The main concept I learned from this project
is the seperation of sections in my HTML code and how to apply certain CSS properties to them.
In case that was hard to understand, I was struggling to apply my CSS rules to my HTML markup
as some things weren't making any differences to my webpage. However, as the project went on,
I realized that it was due to small typos in my HTML. On top of this, I have become more 
familar in the positioning of containers and the elements inside of it using applied visual
design and flexbox.

In conclusion, even though I struggled in the beginning, I had a lot of fun doing this 
mini-project! Hopefully I'm able to spend more time working on more ambitous projects
and most importantly, learn. :)

Thanks for taking the time to look at my repo,
Erik
