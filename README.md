# google-homepage
My first mini-project :)

This is my first ever project done on my own so bare with me as I try to improve my skills.
I am trying to make an exact replica of the google homepage, but the links and buttons
will not go anywhere, this is pure aesthetic. Upon completion, I will update on what I 
learned from the project. Stay tuned!
